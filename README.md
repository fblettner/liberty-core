# **Liberty Core**

## In progress
I'm currently migrate components used in Liberty Framework to be standalone component and npm installable. This work is in progress, any contributions is welcome
 - Documentation and preview of components are available at : [https://docs.nomana-it.fr/liberty-core/](https://docs.nomana-it.fr/liberty-core/)
 - More components will come very soon, they are already in the framework but overridable functions have to be implemented. 

## Announcements
I'm happy to announce that Advanced Grid is now part of Liberty Core components. Advanced Grid contains a lots of feature like 
Editable rows with validation
Dynamic context menus
Column visibility toggles
Filtering, sorting, searching, grouping
Batch selection and clipboard integration
Exporting, importing, and inline editing

If you are are looking for alternative to MUI Datagrid or AG-Grid, this component is free and will stay free for all features included. You can preview this component in the documentation https://docs.nomana-it.fr/liberty-core/. (Forms Component / Advanced Grid)

- **Release 1.0.10**: Issue with focus on input lookup when opening search dialog
- **Release 1.0.9**: Add Authorization for API call
