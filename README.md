**Liberty Core has been rebuilt from the ground up as [Liberty Next](https://github.com/fblettner/liberty-next).**

Liberty Next is a complete rewrite that fixes the structural limitations of this codebase: the heavy `ly_*` metadata-table model is replaced with a **connector-driven architecture** (SQL / API / DB connectors defined in TOML, schema discovered at runtime), giving major improvements in performance, simplicity, and the ability to add forms, reports and lookups without coordinated inserts across half a dozen tables. The frontend is bundled directly inside the project (no external shared libraries), the AI integration uses the Anthropic SDK, and OIDC/Keycloak is first-class.

➡️ **New work happens at [github.com/fblettner/liberty-next](https://github.com/fblettner/liberty-next).**

This repository is kept available for reference and for users still running the v1 applications (NOMASX-1, NOMAJDE, AIRFLOW) until migration tooling lands in Liberty Next. No new features, no bug fixes — please open issues on the new repository instead.

# **Liberty Core**

## In progress
I'm currently migrate components used in Liberty Framework to be standalone component and npm installable. This work is in progress, any contributions is welcome
 - Documentation and preview of components are available at : [https://docs.nomana-it.fr/liberty-core/](https://docs.nomana-it.fr/liberty-core/)
 - More components will come very soon, they are already in the framework but overridable functions have to be implemented. 
 - **New visual component to create dialogs (currently under development), UI is done but API functions have to be implemented** 

## Announcements
I'm happy to announce that Advanced Grid is now part of Liberty Core components. Advanced Grid contains a lots of feature like 
Editable rows with validation
Dynamic context menus
Column visibility toggles
Filtering, sorting, searching, grouping
Batch selection and clipboard integration
Exporting, importing, and inline editing

If you are are looking for alternative to MUI Datagrid or AG-Grid, this component is free and will stay free for all features included. You can preview this component in the documentation https://docs.nomana-it.fr/liberty-core/. (Forms Component / Advanced Grid)

- **Release 1.0.10**: Issue with focus on input lookup when opening search dialog
- **Release 1.0.9**: Add Authorization for API call
- **Release 1.0.8**: include Advanced List and Upload Table
